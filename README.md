# yawab - Yet another WhatsApp book
This project let's you create a book from your WhatsApp chat backup using Python and LaTeX.

## Incentive

A friend of mine decided to start traditional journeyman years after completing his apprenticeship and to wander the country without coming back home for at least 3 years and one day.
The guys and I decided to archive all the chat messages from our cliques WhatsApp group and to hand them out to him as a book on the day of his return.

The project is loosely based on the work of Pelle Beckman (https://github.com/pbeck/whatsbook) and theveloped (https://github.com/theveloped/WhatsBook). Since I plan on changing quite a bit of stuff and on implementing some more sophisticated features I felt like starting my own project instead of forking one of the original WhatsBook repositories. But I really want to thank you guys for your nice preparatory work.
